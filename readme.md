## Face Recognition with Siamese Network

Face recognition is a popular and common application of CNNs. In here, we implement a Siamese network that measures the similarity between two inputs. The goal is to identify whether both input images belong to the same person.

Many of the ideas presented here are from [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf).
